# A_rmf_tests
A respository where I can modify and do test on the open_rmf demos. In order to understand de code. 

I have created my own demo called testA, you may launch it with the command 

ros2 launch rmf_demos_gz testA.launch.xml 

The enviroment of gazebo works and swpans the tinyRobot. The enviroment of rviz also works and shows the path of the robot and the diferen nodes.
