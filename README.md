# A_rmf_tests
A respository where I can modify and do test on the open_rmf demos. In order to understand de code. 

I have created my own demo called testA, you may launch it with the command 

ros2 launch rmf_demos_gz testA.launch.xml 

The enviroment of gazebo works and swpans the tinyRobot. The enviroment of rviz also works and shows the path of the robot and the diferen nodes.

However, now the problem is that I'm not being able to connect with the open_rmf_panel. So all the instruccions are sent by commands.
